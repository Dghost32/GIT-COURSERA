A simple interest calculator that determines the amount of interest earned or owed over a specified time period, based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and duration in years.

**How It Works**

Given:
- `p`: Principal amount (the initial sum of money)
- `r`: Annual rate of interest (as a decimal or percentage)
- `t`: Time period in years

The calculator computes simple interest using the formula:
```
simple interest = p * r * t
```

**Example Usage**

If you invest $1,000 (`p = 1000`) at an annual interest rate of 5% (`r = 0.05`) for 3 years (`t = 3`), the calculation will be:
```
simple interest = 1000 * 0.05 * 3 = $150
```

**Inputs**
- `p`: Principal amount (e.g., 1000)
- `r`: Annual rate of interest (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
- `t`: Time period in years (e.g., 3)

**Output**
- `simple interest`: The calculated interest amount

This tool provides a quick and straightforward way to estimate your simple interest for any principal, rate, and time period.
